  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project builds a back end for an internet retail company. It will solve the problem of allowing the internet retail company to compete in the industry.

  I created the back end functionality for the internet retail company so they can create a database that will keep track of categories, products, & tags associated with the products.

  An employee from the retail internet company will be able to use this back end functionality to display, create, update, and/or delete categories, products, or tags.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Internet company will need to create a front end html page to connect with the server on the back end. 

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  When the internet company would like to display, create, update or delete an new product they will have to make fetch calls from the front end to request the back end server to execute said functions. Please view the tutorial videos for more information.
